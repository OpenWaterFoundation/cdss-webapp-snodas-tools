# cdss-webapp-snodas-tools filestructure

Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS) Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) web application.

The website provides access to archived SNODAS web products that are made available on a static website.

## Getting Started

A standard development folder structure is recommended, consistent with the main
[CDSS SNODAS Tools software](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-app-snodas-tools).
The website development files can be set up as follows (Windows is assumed, but Linux would be similar):

```
> C:
> cd \Users\user
> mkdir CDSS-SNODAS-Tools
> cd CDSS-SNODAS-Tools
> mkdir git-repos
> cd git-repos
> git clone https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/cdss-webapp-snodas-tools.git
```

The repository contains a folder `site` with website files, including top-level `index.html`.
